Welcoem to Mob Manager, AKA Skeleton Attack Simulator 2024!

This program is made to help people playing D&D3.5 (or Pathfinder 1e) do mass skeleton summoning attacks without all the hassel! It is still under development, and probably will never look pretty, but it functions! 

# Current TODOs:
- Add a Crit multiplier field for inputing new skeletons
- Add a "Number of flankers" field so that number of skeletons will be rolled with a flank bonus
